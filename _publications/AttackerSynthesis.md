title: "Automated Attacker Synthesis for Distributed Protocols"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/attacker-synthesis
excerpt: ' In this paper we take a formal approach to the automated synthesis of attackers, ie adversarial processes that can cause the protocol to malfunction. Specifically, given a formal threat model capturing the distributed protocol model and network topology, as well as the placement, goals, and interface (inputs and outputs) of potential attackers, we automatically synthesize an attacker.'

In this paper we take a formal approach to the automated synthesis of attackers, ie adversarial processes that can cause the protocol to malfunction. Specifically, given a formal threat model capturing the distributed protocol model and network topology, as well as the placement, goals, and interface (inputs and outputs) of potential attackers, we automatically synthesize an attacker.
